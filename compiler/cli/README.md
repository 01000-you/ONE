# cli

`cli` is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application framework.

# Background

Many tools in `nncc` are command-line interface (CLI) applications. They generally need to handle command line parameters.
`cli` was written to reduce code duplication across such applications.


# How to use

Please refer to `cli/src/App.test.cpp` for an example.
